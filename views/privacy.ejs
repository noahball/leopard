    <h5><%= schoolFullName %> uses Leopard, a contact tracing system for school buses.</h5>

    <div class="privacy-container">
        <p>Leopard is designed to collect as little information as possible (while still being able to effectively trace
            you if needed).</p>
        <h3>Data Leopard Collects</h3>
        <p>Leopard collects the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full Name</li>
            <li>Tutor Class</li>
            <li>Bus that the student took</li>
            <li>Date/time that the student took the bus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leopard requires this data to provide this service to you. You can opt out by choosing to use the paper form
            provided by a teacher instead of Leopard.</p>
        <h3>Who we share your data with</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored on Firebase and can only be accessed by Leopard's servers (which in turn pass this
            information on to <%= schoolFullName %>'s administrative team). Only <%= schoolFullName %>'s administrative team
            can see lists
            of who has checked in. These lists are designed for contact tracing purposes, however <%= schoolFullName %>
            can use them
            for other purposes if required.<br><b>Leopard does not share your data with any other third parties.</b></p>
        <h3>3rd-party Services</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase RTDB - all user data is stored here.</li>
            <li>Firebase Authentication - used to store admin accounts. Your email address, randomly generated user ID
                and password are stored here. No-one can view your password, even Leopard's developers.</li>
            <li>reCAPTCHA - reCAPTCHA generates a unique token which is used by Leopard's server to verify that you're
                not a bot. No personal information is sent to reCAPTCHA.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cookies that we set</h3>
        <p>idToken: This is only set when visiting the admin area and identifies the currently signed in user<br>Other
            cookies may be set by 3rd-party services, which are out of our control.</p>
        <h3>How long we store your data</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored on Leopard's servers for as long as deemed necessary by <%= schoolFullName %>'s
            administrative
            team. This can be from as little as 14 days to forever. Contact <%= schoolFullName %> directly for more
            information.
        </p>
        <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
        <p>You can request for your data to be deleted by emailing <%= schoolFullName %>'s' administrative team,
            however this data
            cannot be removed until 60 days after the data entered our systems.</p>
        <h3>Getting in touch</h3>
